### Introduction

This R programming assignment requires extracting, and demonstrate the ability to collect, 
work with, and clean a data set. The Dataset is from Samsung and it is titled
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones". The code will involve 
data preparation and steps that involve merging, extraction, 
using descriptive activity names and writing out the output of tidy data.

### Example: Code showing merging files that are involved in this activity

alldataSubject <- rbind(SubjectTrain,SubjectTest)
setnames(alldataSubject, "V1", "subject")
alldataActivity<- rbind(ActivityTrain, ActivityTest)
setnames(alldataActivity, "V1", "activityNum")

dataTable <- rbind(dataTrain, dataTest)
